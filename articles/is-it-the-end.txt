tl;dr: I can feel the end coming.
Yet in the midst of fear there is peace.

This is probably the last blog post I will write.
And it's pretty difficult to write.
Right now, two pieces of media I've consumed come to mind.
The physical state of Griffith after his one year of torture in Berserk.
The self-aware decline of Algernon's lucidity in Flowers for Algernon.

The clinical trial was going well.
After the third dose, I had great hope.
Hope my tumor burden would reduce and my overall energy would come back.

After the fourth dose, that went out the window.
It's actually known by the trial team generally that the fourth and later doses tend to have the highest risk for side effects.

At first, I was stuck in bed vomiting for a week.
After a week of that, I endured a difficult two week hospitalization.
Then I was sent home where I slowly was regaining strength until ... then I wasn't.

Now is an interesting time. I've begun hospice care and I really have no idea where I am in terms of recovery.
On the one hand, I feel myself weakening.
On the other hand, I feel at peace, coming to the end on my own terms.

If you read my other blog posts, the sudden change in trajectory may be shocking.
At the same time, it's hard to explain how suddenly health can change.
Cancer is a tough beast.
And I feel I've lost my fight in a definitive way.

Thank you all for your support and although I hope hospice will provide a way forward for me, I'm also proud of how I've fought and have no regrets.

Sincerely,
Sam
